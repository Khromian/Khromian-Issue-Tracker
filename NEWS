# Khromian 2109-9 (2021-09-13)
- Add NEWS file in the issue tracker for documenting changes.

- Initial prototypes of small images. These have a minimal package set
  with every non-essential application excluded to drive down the file
  size. Some rare firmware is excluded. LZMA compression is used instead
  of Zstd. These are suitable for users who want a very baseline system
  they can configure further, or those with severe space constraints.
  Images should be <1.5GB and the installed system size should be <2.5GB.

- Carlito and Caladea fonts installed by default, allowing LibreOffice to view
  documents written using the Calibri and Cambria fonts with proper metrics.

- Newly preinstalled by personal request: Neofetch, Kolourpaint, KMines, KDialog.
  p7zip-full and p7zip-rar are explicitly brought in.

- The Zstd compression level for the compressed filesystem is increased from
  15 to 17.

- GTK_USE_PORTAL=1 is a default environment variable in order to enable native
  KDE file pickers in Firefox and other select applications that support it.

- Add a PolKit rule that allows users in the "sudo" group to mount external drives
  without entering a password (necessary for KDE automounting to work correctly).
  
- If installing to a BTRFS partition, mount with discard=async on SSDs.

- Rebase against Testing instead of Sid, fixing a notorious issue with Plasma
  being removed due to dependency issues whenever installing the Broadcom or
  NVIDIA driver. This does unfortunately mean reverting to Calamares 3.2.41.1
  with a manual patch to fix BTRFS-on-root. libappindicator1 is temporarily
  cherrypicked from Sid to ease installation of Discord. None of this is kosher!

- Don't include Wine by default, as currently, only Wine 5.0 is available,
  and this causes issues with applications that prefer your system Wine version,
  due to its age. Additionally, Winetricks 20210206 is considerably out-of-date
  and does not reflect the current state of the project. There are also some fair
  concerns that new users who are unfamiliar with Wine may accidentally use
  Windows versions of software even when Linux ports/alternatives are available,
  due to the integration. If we re-add Wine in the future, it should explicitly 
  mention that it is a compatibility layer for Windows applications when launched.
