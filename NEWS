# Khromian 21.10-2 (2021-10-23)
- First public October release after the round of
  testing with 21-10.

- Calamares 3.2.44.2 --> 3.2.44.3

- All branding has been updated for the 2021 redesign.

- Following the recommendation of the PipeWire Debian
  maintainer, WirePlumber is once again the default
  session manager, after previously reverting the
  change due to regressions in default audio device
  selection.
  
- The "packages" step in the installer was
  streamlined so it doesn't have to run a dozen
  separate operations. It also no longer refreshes
  the Apt package listings. This was oddly failing
  for one tester, even though their internet was
  stable. It was redundant anyways.
  
- Some packages related to the proprietary NVIDIA
  driver that were erroneously included in the
  default images are now excluded. This saves on
  a meager amount of space.

- Tilde is now included as an easy CLI text editor,
  suitable for use in tutorials that require editing
  system files but are targeting an audience that may
  still be intimidated by Nano.
 

# Khromian 21-10 (2021-10-08)
- Notable updates:
    Linux 5.10.46 --> 5.14.9
    Chromium 90.0.4430.212 --> 93.0.4577.82
    KDE Frameworks 5.83 --> 5.86
    Calamares 3.2.41.1 --> 3.2.44.2
    LibreOffice 7.1.5 --> 7.2.1

- Both Testing and Sid are included in Apt's sources by
  default, however the system is configured to only draw from
  Testing for all packages except the NVIDIA drivers. This should
  help ensure that the driver is patched for new kernels before the
  kernels migrate to Testing.
  
- Use HTTPS by default with Apt.

- KIO Fuse is preinstalled, for better handling of remote files.

- Plasma Thunderbolt is preinstalled, to appropriately handle
  Thunderbolt devices. This also brings in the Bolt daemon.
  
- Also bringing in: plasma-firewall, plasma-wayland-protocols,
  and plasma-runner-installer.
  
- Better GPU video acceleration for Intel cards,
  including encode support, by preinstalling
  intel-media-va-driver-non-free and
  i965-va-driver-shaders as replacements
  for their free equivalents.

- ZRAM by default  - We're using Zstd compression and scale
  to 2x the full memory size. Physical swap creation (whether
  partition or file) is still available in the installer.
  This should merely make Khromian more functional on
  low-RAM systems by reducing effective RAM usage, as
  well as extend SSD lifetime by reducing the frequency
  of physical swapping.

- vm.swappiness is raised from 1 to 200, to complement
  ZRAM. Additionally, vm.page-cluster is set to 0 as per
  the suggestion in reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/mzun99/
  
- NoHang is now ZRAM-aware, and a bit more aggressive
  when there's low memory pressure, since otherwise
  it would essentially never trigger until dire straits
  when ZRAM was in use.

- Lower the storage minimum from 8.5GiB to 6.5GiB. This isn't a
  major change right now but it'll make things a little less tight.
  Eventually this will be lowered to 3.5GiB once Calamares can
  mount the chroot with all of our fstab options so they apply
  during the extraction process.
  
- Lower the RAM minimum to 0.9GiB. ZRAM makes this possible
  comfortably. You can run a full desktop and even open
  a few YouTube videos on it. It's not a great
  experience, but I see no reason to arbitrarily restrict
  it now.
  
- plasma-discover-backend-snap is included by default, but
  ***not*** snapd. Snaps will remain discouraged, but this
  should hopefully allow for better integration if a user
  ends up requiring and installing snapd.
  
- VKBasalt and MangoHUD are preinstalled, since their installed
  size (even with new dependencies) is very low, and they're
  popular among gamers. libxnvctrl0 is also added to enable
  stats for NVIDIA GPUs, if the proprietary driver is present.
  
- avahi-discover and ImageMagick are excluded by default, as
  they're too niche for most users to care about, and they add
  some ugly entries in the application launcher.

- Images with the NVIDIA drivers preinstalled are built and
  distributed through the "Extras" section. This is probably
  more of a stop-gap. The big problem right now is, for cards new
  enough to lack firmware and/or Nouveau support, a safe graphics
  mode is available in the live environment, but this doesn't carry
  over into the installed system, requiring users to manually add
  nomodeset (and any other relevant parameters) to their boot options
  in order to get in and install the proprietary driver. In these
  cases, having prebaked ISOs avoids boot parameter fiddling.
  Eventually, users should instead have an option during installation
  to install the proprietary drivers (including legacy if needed).
  
- Free images are available in Extras. These are the same as the main images,
  except they only use the "main" component, excluding "contrib"
  and "non-free" firmware and software. This makes them fully DFSG-compliant,
  at the cost of being extremely incompatible with most hardware. Still,
  they're easy enough to build that they're also easy to justify.
  
- On minimal images, the default media player is now MPV instead of Haruna.
  The default minimal browser is now Chromium instead of Falkon, owing
  to the relatively small size increase, the lack of security and extension
  support for QtWebEngine, and the lack of active upstream development on Falkon.

# Khromian 2109-9 (2021-09-13)
- Add NEWS file in the issue tracker for documenting changes.

- Initial prototypes of small images. These have a minimal package set
  with every non-essential application excluded to drive down the file
  size. Some rare firmware is excluded. LZMA compression is used instead
  of Zstd. These are suitable for users who want a very baseline system
  they can configure further, or those with severe space constraints.
  Images should be <1.5GB and the installed system size should be <2.5GB.

- Carlito and Caladea fonts installed by default, allowing LibreOffice to view
  documents written using the Calibri and Cambria fonts with proper metrics.

- Newly preinstalled by personal request: Neofetch, Kolourpaint, KMines, KDialog.
  p7zip-full and p7zip-rar are explicitly brought in.

- The Zstd compression level for the compressed filesystem is increased from
  15 to 17.

- GTK_USE_PORTAL=1 is a default environment variable in order to enable native
  KDE file pickers in Firefox and other select applications that support it.

- Add a PolKit rule that allows users in the "sudo" group to mount external drives
  without entering a password (necessary for KDE automounting to work correctly).
  
- If installing to a BTRFS partition, mount with discard=async on SSDs.

- Rebase against Testing instead of Sid, fixing a notorious issue with Plasma
  being removed due to dependency issues whenever installing the Broadcom or
  NVIDIA driver. This does unfortunately mean reverting to Calamares 3.2.41.1
  with a manual patch to fix BTRFS-on-root. libappindicator1 is temporarily
  cherrypicked from Sid to ease installation of Discord. None of this is kosher!

- Don't include Wine by default, as currently, only Wine 5.0 is available,
  and this causes issues with applications that prefer your system Wine version,
  due to its age. Additionally, Winetricks 20210206 is considerably out-of-date
  and does not reflect the current state of the project. There are also some fair
  concerns that new users who are unfamiliar with Wine may accidentally use
  Windows versions of software even when Linux ports/alternatives are available,
  due to the integration. If we re-add Wine in the future, it should explicitly 
  mention that it is a compatibility layer for Windows applications when launched.
